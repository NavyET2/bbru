# Basketballs-R-Us
#### We sell Basketballs & Basketball Accessories

## _History_
We were founded in 2010 in Rip City, where there was suprisingly no dedicated basketball specialty stores. It was a little dream sparked by SFS's love for basketball and SOS's desire to be a part of a capitalist society. We started our litle business out of SOS's garage selling handmade DIY basketballs, basketball nets, and crocheted wool jerseys. SOS and SFS were so successful that the Damian Lillard from the Portland Trailblazers would stop by the garage evey other week for new team basketballs. 

## _Philosophy_
We strive to provide quality Spalding basketball accessories made from local and renewable sustainable materials to the residents of Portland in order to spread our love of green basketball.

## _Introducing Our Two Star Players_
#### SOS
SOS came to the company when SFS posted on his kickstarter page about starting a green basketball accesory company. SOS, with his enthusiasm for capitalism funded the company outright and became 50/50 partners within the company. You can now find SOS doing accounting, payroll and managerial work.

#### SFS
SFS was the man with the vision and dream to create a sustainable, green basketball company. He came to the business with the skillset of making DIY basketballs, a love of crochet, and superb networking skills. You can find SFS working at our downtown location- passionately producing basketballs, jerseys, and nets.
